            Hitman: Master, I sense the princess coming all by herself. 

            Evil King: The crystal is now ours. You, kill the princess. I can't stand her messing with my plans!

            Hitman: Yes sir!

            Dennis: Ani! Wait, I cannot allow you to by yourself. Have me, Chase Baxter and Melanie Phantom come with you! I will make sure no evil doesn't kidnap you!

            Princess Analia: Alright! As you say! Let's go everyone!

            Hitman: I don't think so! I have got the princess where I want her to be!

            Melanie Phantom: I'm gonna tell you this now. Analia is NOT going with you! So you better get out of our way or else we will fight you!

            Hitman: You underestmate me child. A fight what you get.

            Evil King: Ah, looks like the princess has arrived to get the crystal. What a surprise. 

            Princess Analia: Give it up now evil tyrant!

            Melanie Phantom: The crystal doesn't belong to you!

            Evil King: Hahaha! You thought I would give it to you. When you first ran into me, I defeated all of you the first time. This is the second time. If you win, the crystal will be yours. If I win, I will capture the princess and there will be no way to save her. Deal?
    
            Princess Analia: Very well. This is the final battle. Me and Melanie are a lot stronger to take you down!

            Evil King: Is that so fraglie princess? We'll see about that. Look at me. Feel the wrath of my power!
