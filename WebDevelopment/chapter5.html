            The princess and the phantom are ready to defeat the evil king.

            The evil king as easily defeated the princess and is ready to kill her. Melanie rushes to get Analia up and help her fight back.

            Evil King: Foolish fraglie princess! Did you honestly thought you could defy me? Even I have you in my clutches.

            Princess Analia: I would but you cheated!

            Evil King: It doesn't matter now fraglie princess. My hitman has already got you and is ready to lock you up. Unless you want to challenge me again. 

            Dennis: I don't think so!

            Dennis rushes him and attacks the hitman with a blast of dark magic. Melanie uses her ghost powers to defeat the evil king's minions.

            Princess Analia: Dennis! I'm so glad you're here!

            Dennis: Don't worry. I got you. I wouldn't let him kidnap you. You must vanquish the evil king once and for all! He's been causing a lot of evil to this kingdom! We also have to get the crystal back and return it to the king and queen.

            Evil King: Ah why if it isn't the princess's boyfriend. This will be a challenge. Have you forgotten that my hitman his armored with heavy boots with spikes underneath? Well now's gonna kill you now.

            Dennis: I don't think so! As long as I have my princess close to me, Analia will not lose.

            Princess Analia: Yeah! I don't need to win. I have to make sure you lose!

            Evil King: Really? You're full of surprises. You're absolutely nothing but a scared little princess who cannot even fight back!

            Princess Analia: I may be small but nobody does not treat me like a child!
